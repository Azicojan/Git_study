I'm still practicing Git. At first, it looks like a quite complicated system to learn and grasp, but once you've got it, 
it becomes even more interesting to work with. To the best of my knowledge, there are two Version Control Systems. The first one is
Centralized and the other one which is Git is Distributed. The advantage of Git is that you don't have to always apply to 
the main server and copy the main repo, you can create a branch, then clone any file you would like to work with and that's it. I 
might mistake as I'm learning how to use Git, but I hope that I become much fluent in Git by the end of the course which
I'm taking. 

Now, I'm adding another message to my secondary branch.
